# Federated Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets Imputation method for Air Quality Missing Data

This project is the algorithm codes of paper "Federated Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets Imputation method for Air Quality Missing Data".

## Requires 

Pytorch >= 1.5

python >= 3.6

apex 

## Fast starting
We have uploaded the experiment data sets in the file 'Air_quality_dataset'. You just need to run the 'Fed_mian_run.py'. If you want to modify or change some 
parameters, you can set them in 'param_options.py' or when running code file in cmd adding '--' parameter.
