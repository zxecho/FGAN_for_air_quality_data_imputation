# Federated Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets Imputation method for Air Quality Missing Data

This project is the algorithm codes of paper "Federated Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets Imputation method for Air Quality Missing Data".

### TODO:
+ [ ] Improve project documentation in the future.
+ [X] Update our latest model.

## Requires 

Pytorch >= 1.5

python >= 3.6

apex 

matplotlib

json


## Fast starting
We have uploaded the experiment data sets in the file 'Air_quality_dataset'. 
+ Fisrt step:
  - Run the 'CreateAndLoadDatasets' script to create the training dataset and test dataset.
+ Second step:
  - You just need to run the 'Fed_gain_mian.py'. If you want to modify or change some parameters, you can set them in 'param_options.py' or when running code file in cmd adding '--' parameter.
